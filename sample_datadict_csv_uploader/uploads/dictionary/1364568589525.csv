Delayed Recall (After 3 minutes): ""A while ago I showed you some drawings on separate pieces of paper. You looked at each drawing and then drew it on the same sheet of paper. Do you remember them?

For each picture ask: ""What is the name of this object?' or ""Can you name this?""
Record all responses verbatim. If the response is incorrect, reassure the subject and go to the next item. 
Allow a maximum of 10 seconds for each picture. If the subject cannot produce a name, reassure and move on to the next item.
If the subject makes an error but corrects it spontaneously, score the response as correct.
No semantic or phonetic cueing should be used. A nonspecific prompt can be used if the response is too general.
For example, if the response to the ""canoe"" item is ""boat"" say: ""Is there another name for that?""
You may not ask, ""Isn't that a special kind of boat?"" If the test administrator uses a prompt after a too general response (ex: boat) only the specific response (ex: canoe) is counted correct. Regional terms and synonyms, if verified, are counted as correct.

Acceptable Responses:

Show the words in the first set at the rate of one word every two seconds. 
If the subject cannot read the word, say it for him (or her) and check the 'can't read' column on the response sheet for that word.
After the last word has been read, ask the subject to recall as many words as he (or she) can. 
Allow a maximum of 90 seconds. Continue with the second and third sets of the words in the same way, changing your instructions slightly to encourage the subject.
