BMI 2013 Intro to Clinical Environments Project Repo

Grading is based on amount of "Stuff" contributed to the repository-- this includes total lines, not total amount of "useful" code

i.e. "Show your work"

Class Projects:

Entire group: 
RedLETR     Data Validation + Loading/updating/editing "stuff"
Ameen + Xin = AmeenXin  (like Brangelina but better)

Data Validation-- Components

Components:
Load CSV file
Load Data Dictionary

Form generator/customization script using DHTMLX Gui/Forms

Data Validation (Big part of the project)


Kinect Project  (w/GA Tech):   Sanjay will be "project" lead for this
Daniel Castro is providing the C# code/API for data capture

Data collection via tablets and image collection via Kinect
Network setup -- (DG will help) and storage

REDCap Tablet Based Data Collection:   Stanley aka "TianLei Gangsta" Xu

1)  Nurse/admin picks questionnaires to give to patient
2)  Patient handed a tablet PC
3) Patient answers questions and hits submit
4)  A report is generated on a printer
5)  Wash, Rinse, Repeat
   -->  Only real challenge is making sure the tablet interface is simple enough... REDCap does this though.. 
   and also matching up the  patient ID properly
  
What's required:

REDCap Server
A Tablet
Hope
Prayer

Project #3:  Team Marla--  Clinician workflow report for Heme Onc--
Basically document and potentially suggest "improvements" for drug order entry for HemeOnc...

Bob "Alfredito" Chien will take the lead-- EVERYONE will be rotating/collecting data for this project


REDLetr:  Everyone's project... 

YanHui "L" ---  Prettyification of Forms using DHTMLX Form Builder and REDCap....

Use visual designer to make forms prettyier and more user friendly---
http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/visualDesigner/live/

Plan:  Export Data Dictionary from REDCap which serves as the template for your form
2)  Convert REDCap Data Dictionary syntax into DHTMLX Friendly / actionable code

3)  Submit the form and then we will write a parser to push data back into REDCap (YL will not be responsible for the server side
parsing, just the submit button)







































   


"Gangsta" Project-- Ammeen will be generating a mashup bsad on the popular Korean hit "Gangnam Style" using REDCap and a Kinect sensor



Data collection via tablets in Clinic
Use RedCAP forms-- Design workflow so we can actually USE it!!
Includes patient lookup/identity part
