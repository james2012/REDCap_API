cerad15ibnt_des,cerad_15_item_bnt,,descriptive,"""Now I am going to show you some pictures and I want you to say the name of each picture.""
For each picture ask: ""What is the name of this object?' or ""Can you name this?""
Record all responses verbatim. If the response is incorrect, reassure the subject and go to the next item. 
Allow a maximum of 10 seconds for each picture. If the subject cannot produce a name, reassure and move on to the next item.
If the subject makes an error but corrects it spontaneously, score the response as correct.
No semantic or phonetic cueing should be used. A nonspecific prompt can be used if the response is too general.
For example, if the response to the ""canoe"" item is ""boat"" say: ""Is there another name for that?""
You may not ask, ""Isn't that a special kind of boat?"" If the test administrator uses a prompt after a too general response (ex: boat) only the specific response (ex: canoe) is counted correct. Regional terms and synonyms, if verified, are counted as correct.

Item:
1 House
2 Mask
3 Harmonica
4 Hammock

Acceptable Responses:
1 schoolhouse, hospital
2 doe face, false face
3 mouth organ, french harp, blues harp

""I am going to show you ten printed words. Read each word out loud as I show it to you. Later I will ask you to recall all ten words.""
Show the words in the first set at the rate of one word every two seconds. 
If the subject cannot read the word, say it for him (or her) and check the 'can't read' column on the response sheet for that word.
After the last word has been read, ask the subject to recall as many words as he (or she) can. 
Allow a maximum of 90 seconds. Continue with the second and third sets of the words in the same way, changing your instructions slightly to encourage the subject.

DELAY: 3 minutes

Delayed Recall: 

""A few minutes ago I asked you to learn a list of ten words which you read one at a time from cards. 
Now I want you to try and recall as many of those 10 words as you can.
