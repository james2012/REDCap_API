REDCap Tablet Based Data Collection:   Stanley aka "TianLei Gangsta" Xu

1)  Nurse/admin picks questionnaires to give to patient
2)  Patient handed a tablet PC
3) Patient answers questions and hits submit
4)  A report is generated on a printer
5)  Wash, Rinse, Repeat
   -->  Only real challenge is making sure the tablet interface is simple enough... REDCap does this though.. 
   and also matching up the  patient ID properly
  
What's required:

REDCap Server
A Tablet
Hope
Prayer
